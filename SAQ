A.Class Vs 2.Struct

1.In class all members are private by default that means
data members are only accesiable within the class and 
friend function.
1. An instance of a class is called an ‘object’.	
1.It is declared using class keyword.

2.In structure members are public by default . that means
data members and members function accesilbe outside the class.
2. An instance of structure is called the ‘structure variable’.
2.it is declared using struct keyword.

B.Constructor : It is special method which is autometcly invoke at the time
obj creation.

   1.Default: with no parameter
   2.Paramerized: It allows to initilize obj data member
   with specified value during obj creation.
   3.Copy Constructor: it is a constuctor that initilize an objects 
   by coping the values of other objects of the same class.
  Destructor is to release resources that the objet may have acquired
during its lifetime
C.Pointer : Variable that store memory address and they allow you
to indirectly acces the values by pointing its memory location.
  Reference : Reference is a variable which is another name of existing variable.
  
D.Friend Class and friend functon :
Friend Class : it grant special acess to the private and protected 
member of a class.

Friend Func:Can acces private and protecred member of another class
in which it is declared.

E.Virtual Funcation :It is a member func of base class that
can be overritten in derived class.
Pure Virtual Function: It is a virtual function declard in a bases
class without definition.
  The derived class must provide implmentation for this class.
F.dynamic casting.
Dynamic casting is a feature in C++ that allows you
 to perform type conversions of pointers or references to objects during runtime
