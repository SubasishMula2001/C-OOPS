// Pointer : Variable that store memory address . They allow
// you to indirectly access a variable value by pointing its 
// memory location

// A reference is a variable which is another name of the existing variable, 
// while the pointer is variable that stores the address of another variable.

    // value that is stored at the memory address
    // pointed to by a pointer.
